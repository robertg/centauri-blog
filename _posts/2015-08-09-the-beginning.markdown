It's safe to say that there aren't many space combat simulation games; ones that provide high fidelity into a space ship's
power and thrust management, weapon's systems, and avionics. There also aren't many games that make writing scripts a part of
the normal gameplay experience. I want to offer something truly unique, which is why I didn't release Soar. Soar, while
being an ambitious technical challenge for my teenager self, was just another space fighter clone.

The technical challenges will be interesting which is why I deemed a technical blog to be necessary. For example, the space fighter in this game
requires a virtual machine, with bindings to the ships surface controls. Has this been done in a Unity game before? We will certainly find out if we are the first. Unity is flexible enough that you can feasibly implement anything yourself.

I will announce future blog posts on the mailing list. You can find the subscription form on [centauri.io].
